# Indoor-Vicinity
## Tracking the Indoor Vicinity is a mobile application which is basically an indoor navigation system which enables the user to navigate to a destined location using Augmented Reality. Our project deals with navigation within buildings. It can be used for train stations, airports, shopping centers etc. It can include many other services.
